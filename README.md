Hangman
=======

A word game in which one player selects a word that the other player must guess
by supplying each of its letters: for each incorrect guess a part of a stick
figure of a hanged man  is drawn.

Bugs:
 # The gamer can send a letter without start a game match
 # The gamer can spin the roulette many time during a game match
